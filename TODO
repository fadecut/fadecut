* tinu  remove DOUBLEDIR, use statslog.csv instead
* tinu  complete fileprocessing test in testframework
* tinu  how to handle case of tags? camel, higher or lowercase?
        decide and code it
* tinu  how to handle filenames like this: 
        Gloria Estefan - 1 - 2 - 3.mp3 / gloria_estefan_-_1_-_2_-_3.mp3
        PLATINUM - SIGNALS(GAUDINO & ROONEY EDIT).mp3 / platinum_-_signals(gaudino_&_rooney_edit).mp3 (for example put an underscore before paranthesis)

# --- later --------------------------------------------------------------------
* tinu  change to getopt(1) to be able to parse --long-options
* tinu  cross correlation with well known ad files
* tinu  maybe we could use ffmpeg instead of sox/lame 
* team  statistics reporting
* tinu  wishlist: put a file in $fadecuthome with a list of artist/titles
          start fadecut with special option (-w for example) and fadecut
          will rip/process only files which are on the wishlist.
          this should work with many fadecut processes in parallel, to scan on
          many internet-radio stations in parallel to complete the wishlist as
          fast as possible
* team  catch such errors:
	streamripper http://club-high.rautemusik.fm/listen.pls
	Connecting...
	error -6 [SR_ERROR_CANT_RESOLVE_HOSTNAME]
	bye..
	shutting down
* tinu  mp3 normalization   
* team  find tag on which we write something like 'prcoessed by fadecut vx.y.z'
        incl date, version, time, encoder and its version, streamripper and version
* team  define constant with version of fadecut
* team  lyrics in tags
* team  song/album title
* tinu  id3 tags umlaut are not correct on N900, wrong characterset
