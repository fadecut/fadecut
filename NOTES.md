# --- useful info ---------------------------------------------------------------
to change tags you may use lltag (writes only id3v1 tags):
lltag --yes -g SwissPop -c "Radio Swiss Pop" *.mp3

to change filenames according to tags:
lltag --rename "%a_-_%t" --rename-min --rename-sep _ --yes *.mp3

to change filenames with iso-8859 umlaut to utf8:
convmv -f iso-8859-15 -t utf8 -r *.mp3 --notest

another command line tagging tool, which reads and writes also id3v2:
(and it is able to write lyrics and pictures into the files)
(not useful for reading tags)
* eyeD3 - displays and manipulates id3-tags on mp3 files

Testframework
* list of testfiles needed:
  [done] cut correct - end 01.mp3
  [done] cut correct - begin 01.mp3
  [done] cut correct - begin and end 01.mp3
  [done] error - no tag artist.mp3
  [done] error - no tag title.mp3
  [done] error - no mp3 file.mp3

* Tests:
  outputfiles (cut correct*.*) correct (check binary, length, size, tags)
  error handling when bad input files (error*.mp3) 

ID3
http://www.id3.org/Introduction
ID3 tags were designed with the MP3 file format in mind. ID3v2 tags 
will break formats which are container-based such as Ogg Vorbis and WMA.

Vorbis I specification  
http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html#x1-810005

VorbisComment
http://wiki.xiph.org/VorbisComment
is a base-level Metadata format initially created for use with Ogg Vorbis. 
It has since been adopted in the specifications of Ogg encapsulations for 
other Xiph.Org codecs including Theora, Speex and FLAC.
